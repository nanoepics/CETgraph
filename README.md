# CETgraph version 0.1 #
_First public release by_ **Sanli, 14/11/2017**


In its completed form, this package, should enable identifying thermally-diffusing or electro-actuated single (nano)particles (most probably measured in one of the nanoCET setups), track their position and use this tracking information to identify these particles and their temporal dynamics.

## Project Goals ##

*[x] Identify presence of particles and extract their tracks as they pass through the field of view.  
*[x] Use tracking information (position, intensity, point spread function) to determine  diffusion constants and optical scattering cross section of individual particle and distribution of their properties.
*[x] Generate presentable reports of particle size distribution or other characterized properties.
*[ ] For electro-actuated particles detemine the mobility of the particles.
